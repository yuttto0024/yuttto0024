* Hi, I'm @yuonishi
* I'm interested in low-level programming, operating systems, and hardware control.
* I'm currently learning system programming at 42 Tokyo and studying electrical and electronic engineering at university.
* I'm looking to collaborate on C projects, Go backend applications, and microcontroller projects (Arduino R3, ESP32).
